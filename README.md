## 🔨 The Process

I had wanted to create a project where I would access online information provided through an API. Then I discovered the Spotify API and paired it with React and Vite. I started simple but then added more animations through Framer Motion, letting albums appear smoothly on screen. I was then able to deploy it using Vercel for anyone to use 

## ⏳ Running the Project
